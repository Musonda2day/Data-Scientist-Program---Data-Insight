# Data-Scientist-Program---Data-Insight

The Data Scientist Program is a fully funded one year program by [Data Insight](https://www.datainsightonline.com/data-scientist-program) which is aimed at equiping learners with the key Data Science skills.

Over the course of the program, a number of courses are presented that equips the student with programming, statistical and machine learning skills for driving insights from data and be able to make data driven decisions. 

I was admitted to the program for the September 2022 - August 2023 Cohort. During this period, I will work through a number of assignments and projects for data processing and analysis. This repository contains all of these assignments and projects for the Data scientist Program. 

The works in this repository are published on my [Data Insight Profile](https://www.datainsightonline.com/profile/musonda2day/profile)
